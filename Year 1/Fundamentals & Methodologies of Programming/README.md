# Fundamentals & Methodologies of Programming — Lab Work Collection

This directory contains a collection of **Fundamentals & Methodologies of Programming** lab assignments, implemented entirely in **C++20**, using **Visual Studio 2022** and **CLion**.
The projects cover **object-oriented programming**, classes, inheritance, operator overloading, exception handling, templates, collections (lists, stacks, queues), file I/O (text and binary), serialization, and algorithmic problem solving.

---

## Overview

* Total of **10 laboratory works** in the course.
* **Labs 1–10** are included in this repository.
* The assignments demonstrate the use of **modern C++ features**, **OOP principles**, and standard library containers such as `vector`, `list`, `deque`, and `stack`.
* Several labs include **file processing**, both text (`.txt`) and binary (`.bin`), **sorting algorithms**, and **data structure manipulations**.

All labs follow professional coding practices including **exception handling**, **encapsulation**, **constructors/destructors**, and **operator overloading** where applicable.
