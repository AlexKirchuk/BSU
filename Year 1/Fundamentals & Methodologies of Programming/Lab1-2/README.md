# Lab 1–2 — Working with Numerical Problems

## Description

This laboratory work implements a program that allows a user to choose and solve one of four independent numerical problems. The user can select any task, view its description, provide the required input data, and obtain the result.

The lab is focused on practicing numerical operations, working with digits, and applying logical conditions.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Three-Digit Number by Sum of Cubes

Given a number **M**, find the smallest or the largest three-digit number whose **sum of the cubes of its digits** is equal to **M**.

---

### Task 2: Five-Digit Numbers Product

When two five-digit numbers are multiplied, the result is **123456789**. The task is to find these two five-digit numbers.

---

### Task 3: Special Pairs of Natural Numbers

Given a number **N**, find all pairs of natural numbers not exceeding **N** whose product contains the digits of the larger multiplier separated by zeros.

**Example:**

```
111 × 91 = 10101
```

---

### Task 4: Kaprekar Number

Given a number **A**, determine whether it is a **Kaprekar number**.

A **Kaprekar number** is a non-negative integer whose square can be split into two parts such that the sum of these parts is equal to the original number.

**Example:**

```
45² = 2025
20 + 25 = 45
```

Therefore, **45** is a Kaprekar number.

Kaprekar numbers are named after the mathematician **D. R. Kaprekar**.
