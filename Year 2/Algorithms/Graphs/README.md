# Graph Algorithms — Problem Set

This directory contains a collection of algorithmic problems focused on fundamental concepts in **graph theory**.  
The tasks cover basic graph representations as well as classical algorithms for traversal, shortest paths, and maximum flow.

The goal of this set is to build strong practical understanding of essential graph algorithms and data structures.
