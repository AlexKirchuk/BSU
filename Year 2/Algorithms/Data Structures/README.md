# Data Structures — Problem Set

This directory contains a collection of algorithmic problems focused on **fundamental data structures**.  
The tasks cover binary search trees, heaps, segment trees, hash tables, and related structures.

The goal is to strengthen practical understanding of data structures and their operations in a variety of scenarios.

## 📘 List of Problems

### **0.0 — Sum of Keys in a Binary Search Tree**  
Given a sequence of integers to insert into a BST, compute the sum of all keys.

### **0.1 — Binary Search**  
Perform binary search on a sorted array and for each query return presence and insertion indices.

### **0.2 — Binary Heap Verification**  
Check if a given array can represent a Min-Heap.

### **0.3 — Binomial Heap**  
Given the total number of nodes, determine which binomial trees can constitute a binomial heap.

### **0.4 — Huffman Encoding (Hard Version)**  
Compute the total length in bits of a text encoded using Huffman coding, given only symbol frequencies.

### **0.5 — Road Construction**  
Add roads between cities one by one and determine the number of connected components after each addition.

### **0.6 — Road Destruction (Simple Version)**  
Given a connected city network, determine connectivity after each earthquake destroys one road.

### **0.7 — Road Destruction (Hard Version)**  
Same as 0.6 but with larger constraints, testing efficient graph connectivity algorithms.

### **0.8 — Range Sum Queries**  
Support point updates and range sum queries on an integer array.

### **0.9 — Segment Tree**  
Support point and range updates, and compute range sum, min, and max queries on an array.

### **0.10 — Hash Table with Linear Probing**  
Simulate a hash table with open addressing using linear probing and determine the final contents of each cell.

## ⭐ Individual Problem (Advanced)

### **Problem 33 — Park**

A rectangular park of size **w × h** contains **n trees**, each represented as a point with integer coordinates.  
The park director wants to build a **rectangular children’s playground** whose sides are **parallel to the coordinate axes**.

The playground must satisfy:

- It must lie **entirely inside the park**.  
- No tree may lie **inside** the playground  
  (trees **may** lie on its boundary).  
- Its **area must be maximal**.

You must compute the **maximum possible area** of such a rectangle.

This problem emphasizes **computational geometry**, efficient empty-rectangle search, and working with constraints defined by point obstacles.
