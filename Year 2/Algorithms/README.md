# Algorithm Problem Set

This repository contains a curated collection of **algorithmic problems** solved for practice and study.  
Most solutions are implemented in **C++**, with a few in **Java, Python**, and other languages.

All problems were solved on [**IRunner**](https://acm.bsu.by/), a competitive programming platform used for training and contests.

## 🗂 Sections

The problems are organized into **four main sections**:

1. **Recurrence Relations**  
   Problems involving dynamic programming, combinatorial sequences, string and subsequence analysis, and optimization via recurrence relations.

2. **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**  
   Construction, deletion, traversal, and validation of binary search trees.

3. **Data Structures**  
   Tasks related to advanced structures such as segment trees, heaps, hash tables, and efficient range queries.

4. **Graph Algorithms**  
   Problems involving graph connectivity, path finding, road construction and destruction, and network optimization.
