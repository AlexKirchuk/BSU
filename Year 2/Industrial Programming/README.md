# Industrial Programming — Lab Work Collection

This directory contains a collection of **Industrial Programming** lab assignments, implemented entirely in **Java** using **IntelliJ IDEA**.  
The projects cover object-oriented programming, classes, inheritance, interfaces, collections, serialization, file I/O, and indexing mechanisms.

---

## Overview

- Total of **9 laboratory works** in the course.  
- **Labs 1–8** are included in this directory.  
- **Lab 9** will be developed in a [**separate repository**](https://github.com/AlexKirchuk/Lab-9-Project) as it is a **large-scale project** requiring team collaboration and version control management.

All assignments follow professional coding practices, including **exception handling**, **assertions**, and proper modularization of classes.  
Several labs involve **console applications**, while later labs introduce **collections, serialization**, and **random-access files**.

## Lab Work Sections

1. **Lab 1–3** — Working with **real numbers, arrays, and strings**.  
2. **Lab 4–5** — Classes, **internal classes**, collections, interfaces (`Iterator<T>`, `Iterable<T>`, `Comparable<T>`, `Comparator<T>`).  
3. **Lab 6–7** — **Serialization**, file handling, object persistence, exception management, and localization.  
4. **Lab 8** — Random access files, indexing, and operations on serialized objects.

This directory serves as a **comprehensive reference** for practicing core Java programming concepts and industrial-grade application development.
