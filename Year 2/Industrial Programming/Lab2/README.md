# Lab 2 — Working with Two-Dimensional Arrays (Variant 3, 17, 31)

Develop a **console application in Java** to work with two-dimensional arrays.  
The program should read the **matrix dimensions** and **elements** from the keyboard.

You need to complete **three tasks** selected according to the following rule:  
perform the task with number `14*k + n`, where `k = 0, 1, 2`, and `n` is your sequential number in the group list.  

## Selected tasks for this variant: 3, 17, 31

1. **Task 3:**  
   Print the indices of columns where all elements are even.  
   For each column that has a **negative element on the main diagonal**, also print its index and the **sum of all elements in that column**.

2. **Task 17:**  
   For a given integer matrix, find the **minimum** among the sums of the **absolute values** of elements on diagonals parallel to the **secondary diagonal**.

3. **Task 31:**  
   Sort the **rows of the matrix** in **non-decreasing order** of the **sum of their elements**.
