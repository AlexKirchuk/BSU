# Year 2 — Computer Science Projects Collection

This directory contains a comprehensive collection of **second-year university projects**, covering core areas of **Computer Science** and **Software Engineering**.

The projects emphasize **industrial-grade programming practices**, system-level development, algorithmic problem solving, and full-stack application design.

All work is structured as independent modules with clear separation of concerns, consistent documentation, and automated testing where applicable.

---

## Overview

The **Year 2** coursework consists of three major directions:

- **Algorithms and Data Structures** — algorithmic problem solving and competitive programming
- **Industrial Programming** — object-oriented and production-quality application development
- **Operating Systems** — low-level system programming and interprocess communication

Each section demonstrates a gradual increase in complexity and technical depth.
